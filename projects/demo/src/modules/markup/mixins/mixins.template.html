                I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things
                are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of
                losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are
                going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are
                running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems
                to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is
                unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit
                watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that
                today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes,
                as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad
                - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere
                is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house,
                and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and
                all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living
                rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted
                radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.' Well,
                I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't
                want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you
                to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to
                tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression
                and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
                All I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to
                say, 'I'm a HUMAN BEING, God damn it! My life has VALUE!' So I
                want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your
                chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window.
                Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 'I'M AS MAD AS HELL,
                AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!' I want you to get up
                right now, sit up, go to your windows, open them and stick your
                head out and yell - 'I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to
                take this anymore!' Things have got to change. But first, you've
                gotta get mad!... You've got to say, 'I'm as mad as hell, and
                I'm not going to take this anymore!' Then we'll figure out what
                to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis.
                But first get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your
                head out, and yell, and say it: "I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT
                GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"
